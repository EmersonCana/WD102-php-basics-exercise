# Exercise: Inventory Management System

**Objective:** Create a PHP script that manages an inventory of products. The script should allow you to add products, update their quantity, remove products, and display the inventory list.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Create an Array of Products:**
   - Initialize an associative array to store the products. Each product should have a name, price, and quantity.

2. **Create Functions:**
   - `addProduct`: This function should add a new product to the inventory.
   - `updateProductQuantity`: This function should update the quantity of an existing product.
   - `removeProduct`: This function should remove a product from the inventory.
   - `displayInventory`: This function should display the list of products in the inventory.

3. **Use Conditions and Loops:**
   - Use conditional statements to check if a product already exists when adding or updating.
   - Use loops to iterate through the inventory array when displaying the products.

4. **Test Your Functions:**
   - Call each function with sample data to test if your inventory management system works as expected.
